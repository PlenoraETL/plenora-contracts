# Public profile: io-tools, version 2

Profile identifier: `plenora-io-tools-profile-v2`

Normative target catalog: [`io-tools-v2.json`](../catalogs/io-tools-v2.json)

It supersedes [profile version 1](io-tools.md) as the current target
([decision 0011](../decisions/0011-io-tools-v2.md)). Version 1 remains an
available identity: its catalog and contracts keep their meaning. An artifact
implements exactly one of the two catalog versions (Surface Bindings 1.0 §1).

## Applicable contracts

## Public purpose

The component exposes discovery, inspection, reading, writing and conversion of
external datasets through format-aware public contracts.

## Required operation families

The catalog includes `io.catalog`, `io.inspect`, `io.layers`, `io.read`,
`io.write` and `io.convert`. Three operations change version from profile 1:

| operation | version | output contract | what changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `io.catalog` | 2 | `plenora-io-catalog-v2` | each sink states whether it requires declared geometry types (IO-CAT-001) |
| `io.read` | 2 | `plenora-io-read-result-v2` | the result names the delivered serialization, IPC stream or file (IO-SER-001) |
| `io.write` | 2 | `plenora-io-write-result-v2` | the result names the received serialization, IPC stream or file (IO-SER-001) |

`io.inspect`, `io.layers` and `io.convert` keep version 1 and their contracts.
The input contracts of the three new versions are those of version 1.

A released artifact MAY omit an operation that is not part of that artifact,
but MUST NOT advertise it as available.

Format identifiers are typed operation inputs and entries in the versioned
`io.catalog` result. Format-specific behavior MUST NOT be selected by parsing
file extensions when the operation requires an explicit format.

## Component-owned wire contracts

Before an artifact claims this profile, IO-tools MUST publish immutable schemas
and conformance examples for every operation pair the catalog names:

- `plenora-io-catalog-query-v1` and `plenora-io-catalog-v2`;
- `plenora-io-inspect-input-v1` and `plenora-io-inspect-v1`;
- `plenora-io-layers-input-v1` and `plenora-io-layers-v1`;
- `plenora-io-read-input-v1` and `plenora-io-read-result-v2`;
- `plenora-io-write-input-v1` and `plenora-io-write-result-v2`;
- `plenora-io-convert-input-v1` and `plenora-io-convert-v1`.

These schemas remain owned by IO-tools. This profile fixes their public
identifiers, roles and the cross-component meaning of the members below, not
their internal implementation.

The three version 2 schemas, `plenora-io-read-result-v2`,
`plenora-io-write-result-v2` and `plenora-io-catalog-v2`, are not published in
this repository: IO-tools publishes them, with their examples, in the release
that first claims this profile. Until then no artifact can claim profile
version 2, and the meaning fixed below (IO-SER-001, IO-CAT-001, IO-NULL-001)
is what those schemas MUST encode.

When an IO error includes `details`, the value MUST conform to the
component-owned `plenora-io-error-details-v1` schema. Omitting `details`
remains valid when the four common error axes and optional `code` completely
express the failure.

**IO-SER-001** — `plenora-io-read-result-v2` names the content type of the
dataset it delivered, and `plenora-io-write-result-v2` the content type of the
dataset it received. Each is one of the two the catalog declares for that
operation, `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream` or
`application/vnd.apache.arrow.file`, and it MUST be the serialization of the
bytes actually delivered or received, never a fixed value. The version 1
results describe the file container only; an artifact on profile version 1
that delivers or receives a stream records a deviation.

**IO-CAT-001** — In `plenora-io-catalog-v2`, every writable format carries the
boolean member `requires_declared_geometry_types`. When it is `true`, the sink
refuses, with a typed failure before anything is published, a dataset whose
geometry field carries `plenora.geometry.types_declaration: unresolved`
([Arrow Vocabulary 1.0 §3](../specs/data/ARROW-VOCABULARY-1.0.md)); when it is
`false`, the sink accepts such a dataset. A consumer predicts the refusal by
reading the catalog, without invoking `io.write`. The member says nothing
about which declared types the sink accepts, which stays in the geometry
support of the same entry.

**IO-NULL-001** — In the success results of every IO operation, a member whose
value is JSON `null` means "not applicable to this result": the quantity or
reference does not exist for this dataset, format or outcome. It never means
zero, empty, unknown or failed, and a consumer MUST NOT read it as any of
them. A value that is unknown or failed is reported through a typed member or
a typed failure (Typed Errors 1.0), not through `null`.

## Public surfaces

- Rust API: required.
- CLI: required and governed by CLI 2.0.
- Python SDK: not required by this profile.
- Runtime: required for every I/O operation selected for orchestration.

## Interchange

`io.read` exposes tabular output through Arrow Interchange 1.0 when Arrow is
the declared representation. `io.write` and `io.convert` declare accepted
input and produced output content types.

The versioned `plenora-io-catalog-v2` result is the sole normative source for
format identifiers, accepted options, read/write availability, layer behavior,
geometry and CRS support, fidelity constraints and publish guarantees,
including IO-CAT-001. Capability `attributes` MUST NOT duplicate this matrix.

Loss, coercion or unsupported metadata that changes the public result MUST be
reported through a structured fidelity result or typed failure; it MUST NOT be
silent.

Row-scoped format or mapping failures use
`plenora-row-diagnostics-v1` when diagnostics are advertised.

## External outcomes

Write and convert operations declare local or remote side effects and distinguish
complete publication, rollback, partial publication and unknown durability where
those states are observable.

## Cutover from profile version 1

Profile version 2 is a component major change for IO-tools: the three
operations change version and output contract. CLI protocol v2 and the rules of
profile version 1 on deprecated command spellings continue to apply.

## Not specified here

This profile does not prescribe drivers, parsers, temporary files, spooling,
batch size, GDAL integration or publish algorithms.
